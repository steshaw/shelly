My [[dotfiles][dotfiles]] and [[bin][shell commands]] (and a simple package
system that I haven't used much lately).

** Bootstrapping on a new machine:

#+begin_src bash session
  $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steshaw/shelly/master/bootstrap)
#+end_src

After that, you can run [[bin/post-bootstrap][~post-bootstrap~]] which installs Homebrew/Linuxbrew,
bundle brews [[dotfiles/.Brewfile][a bunch of packages]], and checks out myrepos.

#+begin_src bash session
  $ post-bootstrap
#+end_src
