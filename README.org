* Shelly

My [[dotfiles][dotfiles]], [[scripts][shell scripts]], and a simple package
system that I haven't used much lately.

** Installation

I bootstrap on a new machine like this:

#+begin_src bash session
  $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steshaw/shelly/master/bootstrap)
#+end_src

After that, I tend to run [[bin/post-bootstrap][post-bootstrap]] which installs [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]/[[https://linuxbrew.sh/][Linuxbrew]],
bundle brews [[dotfiles/.Brewfile][a bunch of packages]], and checks out repos via [[https://myrepos.branchable.com/][myrepos]].

#+begin_src bash session
  $ post-bootstrap
#+end_src
