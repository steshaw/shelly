My [[dotfiles][dotfiles]], [[scripts][shell scripts]], and a simple package
system that I haven't used much lately.

** Installation

I bootstrap on a new machine like this:

#+begin_src bash session
  $ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steshaw/shelly/master/bootstrap)
#+end_src

After that, I tend to run start a new shell to ensure all shell dotfiles are
installed correctly and run [[scripts/post-bootstrap][post-bootstrap]]:

#+begin_src bash session
  $ post-bootstrap
#+end_src

This installs either:

- A Nix overlay.
- [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]/[[https://linuxbrew.sh/][Linuxbrew]]
  and all packages from [[dotfiles/.Brewfile][~/.Brewfile]].

Then clones all my git repositories via [[https://myrepos.branchable.com/][myrepos]].
