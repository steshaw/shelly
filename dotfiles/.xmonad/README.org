* My Xmonad configuration

If Spacemacs is configured to use =ghcide= for it's Haskell LSP support,
then suggestions and type definitions work as expected while editing
=xmonad.hs=.

Can be built with Stack, Cabal, Nix, and---of course---Xmonad.

#+begin_src sh-session
$ stack build

$ nix-shell --command 'cabal v2-build'

$ build # Script invokes =nix-build=
#+end_src

The =build= script makes use of the =gen-nix-files= script (which also
generates =cabal.project.freeze=). The dependencies are frozen using
[[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stack2cabal][stack2cabal]] (recommended [[https://medium.com/@fommil/why-not-both-8adadb71a5ed][here]]). Then =cabal2nix= generates the Nix files.
These need a minor patch due to the root directory beginning with a dot
(i.e. =.xmonad=).
